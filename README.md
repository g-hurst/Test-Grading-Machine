# Test-Grading-Machine

This is a code that I made for a class project. It has the user enter up to 20 test answers (A, B, C, or D) and stores them in an ArrayList. 
The user is then prompted to enter student responses to the test. Once all the student reponses are entered, the code displayed if the student passed
or failed the test (>= 75% is a pass) and asks the user if they would like a breakdown of the score. If yes, the number of correct answers, incorect answers,
and questions missed with both the correct and student response is displayed. If no, the program ends. 

I have attached the rubric that this project was scored from to this repository as well.
